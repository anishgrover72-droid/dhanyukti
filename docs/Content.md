# Content & copy system

Every word the family sees or hears: voice and tone, fixed terms, and bilingual copy tables. Strings marked **(code)** are copied from the current source so the doc and the app agree. Where the copy should change, a **Suggested:** note sits next to it. Change the code and this doc in the same PR. Strings marked **(new)** are not built yet.

Owners: engines / Hindi copy (strings in `api/app/engines/*.py`), screens (strings in `web/src/**`). Visual rules: [Design.md](Design.md). Term definitions: [Glossary.md](Glossary.md).

**Placeholders:** `{name}`, `{amt}` (formatted `₹3,000`), `{day}` (a number such as `28`), `{date}` (such as `28 Sep`), `{n}`. Values always come from the API (Rules §2). Copy never computes them.

---

## 1. Voice and tone

We sound like **a trusted elder sister who is good with money**: warm, direct and never preachy.

| Principle | Do | Don't |
|---|---|---|
| Warm, not clinical | "Chalo, agle mahine ₹500 bachate hain" | "You overspent by ₹500" |
| No shame | "Fee salary se 2 din pehle hai" (the calendar is the problem) | "Aapne planning nahi ki" |
| No fear | "Agar nahi kiya: app loan lena pad sakta hai" (a fact plus a cost) | "Danger! You will default!" |
| Rupees, not percentages | "₹3,000 par 15 din mein ₹340 byaaj" | "276% APR" |
| Days, not ratios | "Bina aamdani 12 din chal payenge" | "Liquidity ratio 0.4" |
| One ask | "Aaj ka kaam: ek message bhejein" | Three tasks in one card |
| Credit the family | "Shabaash! Gullak mein paisa gaya" | "Task completed" |
| Honest about certainty | "Andaaza" / "Pata nahi" | Show ₹0 when data is missing |
| We explain, the rules count | "Niyam ginte hain, AI sirf samjhata hai" | "Our AI thinks you should…" |
| Respectful address | "{name} ji" in Hindi. First name in English | "Dear customer" |

**Banned words and phrases:** overspent, fail/failed (for a person), default (as a threat), bad, irresponsible, "you must", galti, bekaar kharch (for a person's spending), "last chance", ALL-CAPS warnings. Also banned: any fund, stock or policy *name* offered as a recommendation.

**Allowed urgency:** "Abhi karein" (Act now) appears only as a tier label with its icon. The urgency comes from a **date** ("28 tareekh ko"), not from adjectives.

## 2. Language rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Primary language | Romanised Hinglish, the way people type on WhatsApp ("Aaj kharch kar sakte hain"). Devanagari is not used in body copy for v1. |
| Secondary language | English sub-line under the Hinglish line (`Bi` component), 12 px, muted. Hidden in Pro mode. When the user picks EN, English becomes primary and Hinglish becomes the sub-line. |
| Devanagari | Tab labels (घर लक्ष्य पूछो इनाम परिवार), language names (हिंदी, मराठी), the wordmark धनयुक्ति, and the toggle label "हिं". |
| Numbers | `₹` + Indian grouping: `₹30,000`, `₹1,00,000`. Say "₹2 lakh" for round lakhs. Never "Rs." or "INR". Negative amounts use the true minus sign: `−₹3,000`. |
| Dates | Hinglish: "28 tareekh ko", "28 Sep". English: "on the 28th", "28 Sep". Month names are always short English (Sep, Oct), even in Hindi. |
| Rates | Loans: rupees charged over days. Debt load: "₹14/₹100" (debt per ₹100 earned). Never "%". |
| Honorific | Hinglish: "{name} ji" in greetings, the reveal step and protection cards. |
| Speech | TTS replaces `₹` with "rupaye" / "rupees". Write numbers so they read aloud cleanly: no ranges with "/", say "150 se 300" in speech. |
| Length | Card title ≤ 40 characters. Body ≤ 90. Task ≤ 120. Button ≤ 3 words. |
| Sentence case | Always sentence case. Uppercase is used only for eyebrow labels (AAJ KA KAAM) and tags. |

## 3. Glossary of fixed product terms

**Suggested:** the English for level 3 is "Plant" in `rewards/page.tsx` and "Sapling" in `api/app/game/service.py`. Use **Sapling** everywhere.

## 6. Dual-Consent Passport

Every consent card has the same three rows with icons: 👁 **Kya dekhenge** · 🎯 **Kyon** · ⏳ **Kab tak**.

| Card | Row | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Parivaar ki jaankari** (tag DPDP, rose) | Kya dekhenge | Parivaar, kaam, bhasha, phone ke signal | Family, work, language, phone signals |
| | Kyon | Sahi bhasha aur sahi salah ke liye | To pick the right language and guidance |
| | Kab tak | Jab tak aap mita na dein | Until you delete it |
| | Choices | ✓ Haan / Phone signal nahi | ✓ Yes / No phone signals |
| **2. Bank ka len-den** (tag AA · Anumati, ink) | Kya dekhenge | Aapke bank ka 6 mahine ka len-den, RD, bima | 6 months of bank transactions, RD, insurance |
| | Kyon | Taaki mahine ke aakhir mein paise kam na padein | So you don't run short at month-end |
| | Kab tak | 3 mahine. Kabhi bhi band kar sakte hain | 3 months. Stop anytime |

All rows above are (code) from `onboarding/page.tsx`. **Suggested:** the DPDP card says "salah" (advice) in "sahi salah ke liye". Use "sahi jaankari ke liye" so the card never implies advice.

**Parivaar → Consent Passport (code, `routers/consent.py`):**

| Hinglish | English | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Ghar ke paise ka hisaab (Personal finance management) | Personal finance management | AA purpose |
| 1 din — hisaab ke baad kachcha data delete | 1 day — raw data deleted after compute | AA data life |
| Tak {date} | Until {date} | AA expiry |
| Consent band karein | Revoke consent | AA card button |
| + Bank jodein (Anumati AA) | + Link bank (Anumati AA) | Empty state |
| DhanYukti data fiduciary | DhanYukti as data fiduciary | DPDP card header |
| Ghar ka profile — Aapke parivaar ke hisaab se salah dene ke liye | Household profile — To tailor advice to your family | DPDP row. **Suggested:** "…sahi jaankari dene ke liye" |
| Phone ke signal (SMS) — Bill aur EMI ki tareekh pakadne ke liye | Device signals (SMS) — To catch bill and EMI dates | DPDP row |
| Ration card — Sarkari yojana ki patrata dekhne ke liye | Ration card — To check scheme eligibility | DPDP row |
| Bijli bill — Bill ki tareekh aur rakam jaanne ke liye | Electricity bill — To know bill dates and amounts | DPDP row |
| Gaadi ka RC — Gaadi loan aur bima check karne ke liye | Vehicle RC — To check vehicle loan and insurance | DPDP row |
| EPF passbook — PF bachat ko suraksha mein ginne ke liye | EPF passbook — To count PF savings in your safety net | DPDP row |
| Jab tak aap band na karein / Band | Until you turn it off / Off | DPDP "until" |
| Har jaankari ke liye alag permission. Sirf tab poochte hain jab isse faisla badle. | Separate consent for each. We only ask when it changes a decision. | Enrich footnote (code) |
| Haan, jodo | Yes, add | Enrich button (code) |

**Sharing levels (code):** Poora / Sirf total / Sirf mere liye → Full / Totals / Private.

## 7. Anumati approval screen (`/anumati`, replay stand-in)

This screen is intentionally mostly English, because it mirrors the AA's own UI. It is never DhanYukti-branded.

| Hinglish | English | Element |
|---|---|---|
| SANDBOX SIMULATION · replay mode | same | Chip (code) |
| Anumati — Account Aggregator | same | Header (code) |
| RBI-licensed consent manager · +91 98xxxxxx10 | same | Sub (code) |
| DhanYukti aapke data ke liye consent maang raha hai | DhanYukti is requesting consent for your data | Request line (code) |
| Purpose: Personal finance management · FI types: DEPOSIT, RECURRING_DEPOSIT, INSURANCE_POLICIES · Range: Last 6 months · Frequency: Monthly (periodic) · Valid till: 90 days · Data life: 1 day | same | Definition list (code) |
| Mile khaate | Accounts discovered | (code) |
| OTP (sandbox: any 6 digits) | same | (code) |
| Aadhaar se khaate nahi dhoondhe jaate | Accounts are never discovered using Aadhaar | Trust line (code) |
| Mana karein / Manzoor karein | Reject / Approve | Buttons (code) |
| **(new)** Koi baat nahi. Bank jode bina bhi aap Gullak aur Poocho use kar sakte hain. | No problem. You can still use Gullak and Poocho without linking a bank. | Passport step after Reject. **Suggested:** today Reject silently returns to the passport step |

| Bachav ke din · Sabse badi kami | Resilience days · Biggest shortfall | Result tiles (code) |
| Parivaar mission · {amt} / {target} bacha liye · {n}% | Family mission · saved | Mission (code). **Suggested:** drop "· {n}%", because the bar already shows it (rule 4) |
| Kahaan gaya paisa · Pichhla mahina | Where did the money go · Last month | Donut (code) |
| Ghar (kiraya, bill, fee) · Khana-peena · EMI / karz · Bachat / bima · Baaki (cash, dawai, anya) | Home (rent, bills, fees) · Food & groceries · EMIs / loans · Savings / insurance · Other (cash, medicine, misc) | Donut slices (code, `pipeline.py`) |
| Hamara hisaab vs Perfios analytics | Our E01 vs Perfios analytics | DataSource (code) |
| Live sandbox · Replay (recorded sandbox) · Demo fixture | same | DataSource mode (code) |

**Scenario messages** come from `/simulate` (code, `pipeline.py`). Examples:
- "School fee 30 tareekh ko dene se ₹3,000 ki kami khatam. Par 29 Sep tak ₹{fg} safety floor se kam rahega — 5 din ₹200 kam kharch karein ya Gullak use karein."
- "₹20,000 ke achanak kharch se {day} tareekh ko {amt} kam padenge. Bina aamdani {n} din chal payenge."

## 9. The four metrics, confidence and status words

| Metric (engine) | Label (hi / en) | Value format | Sub-line (hi / en) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Safe to Spend (E03) | Aaj kharch kar sakte hain / Safe to spend today | `₹{amt}` | Salary ({date}) tak, zaroori kharch ke baad / Until salary on {date}, after essentials · *(no salary)* Agle 14 din, zaroori kharch ke baad / Next 14 days, after essentials · *(₹0)* Sirf zaroori kharch (₹{amt}/din) / Essentials only (₹{amt}/day) |
| Resilience Days (E05) | Bina aamdani kitne din / Days covered without income | `{n} din` / `{n} days`. On Home: "din ka bachav" / "days of safety" | Bachat ₹{a} ÷ roz ₹{b} / Savings ₹{a} ÷ ₹{b}/day. **Suggested:** "Bachat ₹{a}, roz ka zaroori kharch ₹{b}", with no ÷ sign |
| Debt load (E04) | ₹100 kamai par karz / Debt per ₹100 earned | `₹{n}/₹100` | EMI ₹{amt}/mahina · {n} app loan (3 mahine) / EMIs ₹{amt}/month · {n} app loans (3 months) |
| Protection (E06) | Suraksha (bima) / Protection (insurance) | Poora / Aadha / Nahi → Covered / Partial / None | "{name}: jeevan bima nahi · Ayushman: pata nahi" / "{name}: no life cover · Ayushman: unknown" · Sabka bima hai / Everyone is covered |

All rows are (code) from `pipeline.py`, `e04_debt.py`, `e06_protection.py` and `HealthTiles.tsx`. When a value is missing, show **Pata nahi / Unknown**. Never show ₹0.

| Confidence | Hinglish | English | Dot | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pakka` | Pakka | Confirmed | leaf | Seen in AA data |
| `andaaza` | Andaaza | Estimate | amber | Inferred from a pattern |
| `pata_nahi` | Pata nahi | Unknown | muted | No data. Ask the family or leave it blank |

| Status | Hinglish | English | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| green | Surakshit | Safe | CircleCheck |
| amber | Dhyaan dein | Watch | CircleAlert |
| red | Abhi karein | Act now | OctagonAlert |

| NBA tier | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Abhi karein | Act now |
| 2 | Suraksha | Protect |
| 3 | Majboot banayein | Build |
| 4 | Badhayein | Grow |

Other status words (code): Bima hai / Bima nahi (Covered / No cover) · RBI list mein / RBI list mein nahi · KAMAANE WALE (EARNER) · ACTIVE / REVOKED · PAKKA / BATAYA (EVIDENCED / REPORTED) in the Value Ledger. **Suggested:** in the Value Ledger, use **SABOOT** instead of PAKKA so it doesn't clash with the confidence label "Pakka".

## 10. Hero NBA cards (E14, `api/app/engines/e14_nba.py`)

Card fields: **title** · **body** · **task** (Aaj ka kaam) · **if_not** (Agar nahi kiya) · **second_step** (↳) · **action label** · Kyon? **rule** · label (jaankari/referral) · points.

### Household A — Sunita & Ramesh Yadav, Panipat

**A1. Month-End Radar (tier 1, red, icon `school`, E03, +25)**

| Field | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| title | 28 tareekh ko ₹3,000 kam padenge | You'll be ₹3,000 short on the 28th |
| body | School fee (₹5,000) salary se 2 din pehle hai. | The school fee comes 2 days before salary. |
| task | School se fee 30 tareekh tak badhane ki request bhejein. Hum message likh denge. | Ask the school to move the fee to the 30th. We'll write the message. |
| if_not | App loan lena pad sakta hai, lagbhag ₹150–₹300 kharcha. | You may need an app loan, costing about ₹150–₹300. |
| second_step | Fee badhne ke baad bhi ₹{fg} kam — 5 din ₹200 kam kharch, ya Gullak se. | Even after moving the fee, you're ₹{fg} below your safety floor — spend ₹200 less for 5 days, or use the Gullak. |
| action | Message taiyaar hai — bhejein | Message ready — send it |
| rule | Salary 30 ko aati hai, fee 28 ko hai | Salary arrives on the 30th, the fee is due on the 28th |
| label / confidence | Jaankari · from engine | |

**Suggested:** the Hinglish second_step is missing "safety floor se". Use "Fee badhne ke baad bhi ₹{fg} suraksha rekha se kam — …".

**A2. Lender Shield (tier 1, red, icon `loan`, E04, +25)**

| Field | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| title (code) | QuickRupee RBI list mein nahi — saal ka ~276% kharcha | QuickRupee isn't on RBI's list — ~276% a year |
| **Suggested title** | QuickRupee RBI list mein nahi — ₹3,000 par 15 din mein ₹340 byaaj | QuickRupee isn't on RBI's list — ₹340 for 15 days on ₹3,000 |
| body | 3 mahine mein 2 app loan. QuickRupee ne ₹3,000 par 15 din mein ₹340 liye. | 2 app loans in 3 months. QuickRupee charged ₹340 on ₹3,000 for 15 days. |
| task | Agli baar app loan se pehle bank se overdraft ya chhota loan poochhein. App RBI list mein hai ya nahi, check karein. | Before the next app loan, ask your bank for an overdraft or small loan. Check whether the app is on RBI's list. |
| if_not | Har baar ~₹300 extra, aur galat app se dhamki aur data ka khatra. | About ₹300 extra each time, plus risk of harassment and data misuse from unregistered apps. |
| second_step | Dhamki ya galat vasooli ho to sachet.rbi.org.in par shikayat karein. | If you face threats or unfair recovery, complain at sachet.rbi.org.in. |
| action | Sasta vikalp dekhein | See a cheaper option |
| rule (code) | RBI list mein nahi, ya saal ka kharcha 36% se zyada = khatra | Not on RBI's list, or costing over 36% a year = danger |
| **Suggested rule** | RBI list mein nahi, ya ₹100 par saal ka ₹36 se zyada kharcha = khatra | Not on RBI's list, or over ₹36 a year per ₹100 = danger |
| Lender row verdict (code) | RBI ki list mein nahi — saal ka ~276% kharcha. Isse bachein. | Not on RBI's list — costs ~276% a year. Avoid. |
| Lender row line (code) | ₹3,000 liye, 15 din mein ₹340 byaaj gaya | Borrowed ₹3,000, paid ₹340 in 15 days |

**A3. Penalty saver (tier 3, amber, icon `bolt`, E01, +25)**

| Field | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| title | 6 mahine mein ₹590 bank charges kate | ₹590 lost to bank charges in 6 months |
| body | Min balance na rakhne aur EMI bounce ke charges. | Charges for low minimum balance and a bounced EMI. |
| task | EMI (₹4,200) se ek din pehle khate mein paisa rakhein; SMS alert chalu karein. | Keep money in the account a day before the EMI (₹4,200); turn on SMS alerts. |
| if_not | Har mahine ~₹100 aise hi katenge. | About ₹100 will keep getting cut every month. |
| action | Yaad dilayein → reminder "Kal EMI hai — khate mein paisa rakhein" | Set reminder → "EMI tomorrow — keep money in the account" |
| rule | CHRG / RTN wali entries = bank charges | Entries marked CHRG / RTN = bank charges |
| label / confidence | Jaankari · Pakka | |

The EMI amount is the engine's monthly EMI total (Bajaj ₹2,100 + HDFC ₹2,100 in the fixture). **Suggested:** the "Yaad dilayein" action currently opens the generic 5-day plan sheet. Give it its own reminder confirmation: "Har mahine 4 tareekh ko yaad dilayenge ✓".

### Household B — Farida Sheikh, Indore

**B1. Protection check (tier 2, red because she is the sole earner, icon `shield`, E06, +50)**

| Field | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| title | Ghar ki akeli kamane wali — ₹436 saal mein ₹2 lakh ka jeevan bima (PMJJBY) | Only earner at home — ₹2 lakh life cover for ₹436 a year (PMJJBY) |
| body | Saath mein PMSBY: ₹20/saal mein ₹2 lakh durghatna bima. Ayushman card ki patrata bhi dekhein. | Also PMSBY: ₹2 lakh accident cover for ₹20/year. And check Ayushman eligibility. |
| task | Bank mein PMJJBY + PMSBY form bharein (auto-debit). Ayushman patrata online check karein. | Fill the PMJJBY + PMSBY form at your bank (auto-debit). Check Ayushman eligibility online. |
| if_not | Kuch ho gaya to parivaar ke paas koi sahara nahi rahega. | If something happens, the family has no safety net. |
| action | Bima kaise lein → links: jansuraksha.gov.in, beneficiary.nha.gov.in ("Sarkari site") | How to enrol → "Official site" |
| note | Premium official site par dobara check karein. | Re-check the premium on the official site. |
| rule | 6 mahine mein koi bima premium nahi kata; ghar ki aamdani is vyakti par tiki hai | No insurance premium debited in 6 months; household income depends on this person |
| label | Jaankari | |

> ⚠️ **₹436 PMJJBY premium: re-check on the official site (jansuraksha.gov.in) before the demo.** It lives in `e06_protection.PMJJBY_PREMIUM` and is also hard-coded in `routers/ask.py`. **Suggested:** make `ask.py` read the constant. Also re-check PMSBY ₹20.

**Suggested:** "if_not" leans on fear. Use "Kuch ho jaaye to Ayaan aur Sana ke liye ₹2 lakh ka sahara rahega — sirf ₹436 saal mein." ("If anything happens, Ayaan and Sana would have ₹2 lakh — for just ₹436 a year.")

**B2. Ayushman check (inside the protect sheet)**

| Hinglish | English |
|---|---|
| Ayushman patrata pata nahi — beneficiary.nha.gov.in par mobile number se dekhein | Ayushman eligibility unknown — check with your mobile number at beneficiary.nha.gov.in |
| Hum koi policy nahi bechte. Enrolment bank ya licensed intermediary se hoga. (code) | We don't sell policies. Enrolment is via your bank or a licensed intermediary. |

Per-member notes (code, fixtures): Farida "Koi bima nahi · Ayushman patrata pata nahi". Zubeda "Ayushman (70+ nahi) — patrata check karein". Children "Health cover nahi".

### Household C — Arjun & Meena Nair, Coimbatore

**C1. Idle money → education Gullak (tier 4, green, icon `grow`, E13, +50, Referral)**

| Field | Hinglish | English |
|---|---|---|
| title | ₹52,000 bekaar pade hain | ₹52,000 is sitting idle |
| body | {bank} khate mein {n} din se bina istemal ke pade hain. | Unused in your {bank} account for {n} days. |
| task | ₹34,000 Kavya ke padhai Gullak mein rakhein; baaki ₹18,000 emergency ke liye. RD / recurring SIP ke baare mein SEBI-registered salahkar se samjhein. | Move ₹34,000 into Kavya's education jar; keep ₹18,000 for emergencies. Learn about RDs / recurring SIPs from a SEBI-registered adviser. |
| if_not | Mehngai se paisa har saal thoda ghat-ta hai. | Inflation quietly shrinks idle money every year. |
| second_step | Hum koi fund nahi batate — sirf jaankari. Nivesh ki salah SEBI RIA se lein. | We never name a fund — information only. Take investment advice from a SEBI RIA. |
| action | Padhai Gullak mein daalein | Move to education jar |
| learn chips | RD: har mahine tay rakam, tay byaaj · Recurring SIP: bazaar se juda, jokhim hai | RD: fixed amount monthly, fixed interest · Recurring SIP: market-linked, carries risk |
| rule | 90+ din se khate se koi nikasi nahi = bekaar paisa | No withdrawal for 90+ days = idle money |
| label / confidence | **Referral** · Pakka | |

₹34,000 = ₹52,000 − 30 days × ₹600 essentials, rounded down to ₹1,000 (the engine's value). **Suggested:** "bekaar" can sound like a judgement. Use "₹52,000 khaali baithe hain" ("₹52,000 is sitting unused").

**Suggested (new) referral line under the action:** "SEBI RIA se baat karein · DhanYukti ko is referral se ₹0 milta hai" (see §17).

## 15. 60-second micro-lessons

At TTS rate 0.95, about 140–150 words is roughly 60 s. One idea per lesson, one story, rupees only, and one action at the end. Tapping a lesson awards +15 ("Naya sabak seekha!").

### L1 — App loan ka asli kharcha (Hinglish; code has a shorter version)

**Card label (code):** Ramesh ne app se ₹3,000 liye… / Ramesh borrowed ₹3,000 from an app…

**Suggested script (replaces the code version, which says "sau pratishat se bhi zyada"; that breaks rule 4):**

> Ramesh ji ko mahine ke aakhir mein teen hazaar rupaye chahiye the. Phone par ek app ne do minute mein paisa de diya. Pandrah din baad unhe teen hazaar teen sau chaalis rupaye lautane pade. Yaani teen sau chaalis rupaye sirf pandrah din ka kharcha. Agar aise hi saal bhar udhaar chalta rahe, toh teen hazaar par aath hazaar rupaye se zyada sirf byaaj mein chale jaate. Bank ka overdraft ya chhota loan isse kaafi sasta padta hai. Loan lene se pehle teen baatein dekhein. Ek: kya app RBI ki list mein hai? Do: kul kitne rupaye lautane honge — sirf EMI nahi, poora jod. Teen: kya app aapke contacts aur photos maang raha hai? Agar haan, toh ruk jaayein. Aur agar koi app dhamki de, toh sachet dot rbi dot org dot in par shikayat karein. Yaad rakhein: jaldi ka paisa, sabse mehenga paisa.

> *EN:* Ramesh needed three thousand rupees at month-end. An app gave it in two minutes. Fifteen days later he repaid three thousand three hundred and forty. That's three hundred and forty rupees for just fifteen days. Borrow like that all year and more than eight thousand rupees goes to interest on three thousand. A bank overdraft or small loan is much cheaper. Before borrowing, check three things. One: is the app on RBI's list? Two: how much will you repay in total — not just the instalment. Three: is the app asking for your contacts and photos? If yes, stop. If an app threatens you, complain at sachet.rbi.org.in. Remember: fast money is the most expensive money.

(₹340 × 365 ÷ 15 ≈ ₹8,270. This comes from the E04 inputs, not from copy maths. Engines/copy: confirm before recording.)

### L2 — Emergency Gullak: bachav ke din

> Farida ji ki silai ki kamai kabhi zyada, kabhi kam. Ek mahine bachche ko bukhaar hua, teen din kaam band raha, aur ghar ka kharch chalta raha. Isliye ek alag Emergency Gullak zaroori hai. Pehle apna roz ka zaroori kharch jaaniye — khaana, kiraya, bijli, EMI. Maan lijiye roz ka zaroori kharch paanch sau rupaye hai. Toh tees din ka bachav banane ke liye pandrah hazaar rupaye chahiye. Ek saath nahi — roz pachaas rupaye se shuru kariye. Kamai aate hi pehle Gullak mein daaliye, phir baaki kharch. Yeh paisa sirf musibat ke liye hai — tyohaar ya shopping ke liye nahi. Jitne din ka bachav, utni kam chinta, aur utna kam udhaar. DhanYukti aapko roz batayega ki aap kitne din surakshit hain.

> *EN:* Farida's tailoring income goes up and down. One month her child had a fever, work stopped for three days, and the household still had to run. That's why a separate emergency Gullak matters. First, know your daily essentials — food, rent, electricity, EMI. Say that's five hundred rupees a day. Thirty days of safety means fifteen thousand rupees. Not all at once — start with fifty rupees a day. When income arrives, put money in the Gullak first, then spend. This money is only for emergencies — not festivals or shopping. The more days of safety, the less worry and the less borrowing. DhanYukti will show you every day how many days you're covered.

### L3 — PMJJBY: ₹436 mein ₹2 lakh ka jeevan bima

> ⚠️ Re-check ₹436 (PMJJBY), ₹20 (PMSBY), the age limits and the renewal window on jansuraksha.gov.in before the demo.

> Ghar ki kamai ek insaan par tiki ho, toh unka jeevan bima sabse zaroori suraksha hai. Sarkar ki Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana — PMJJBY — mein saal ke chaar sau chhattis rupaye mein do lakh rupaye ka jeevan bima milta hai. Yaani mahine ke lagbhag chhattis rupaye. Atthaarah se pachaas saal ki umar wale, jinka bank khata hai, jud sakte hain. Premium saal mein ek baar khate se apne aap katta hai. Saath mein PMSBY — sirf bees rupaye saal mein do lakh ka durghatna bima. Bank ya post office mein ek form bhariye, aur nominee ka naam zaroor likhiye. Premium katne ki tareekh par khate mein paisa rakhiye, warna bima ruk sakta hai. DhanYukti koi policy nahi bechta — hum sirf batate hain. Form aapka bank bharega.

> *EN:* When a home depends on one person's income, their life cover is the most important protection. The government's PMJJBY gives two lakh rupees of life cover for four hundred and thirty-six rupees a year — about thirty-six rupees a month. Anyone aged eighteen to fifty with a bank account can join. The premium is auto-debited once a year. Add PMSBY — just twenty rupees a year for two lakh of accident cover. Fill one form at your bank or post office, and always name a nominee. Keep money in the account on the premium date, or the cover can lapse. DhanYukti sells no policy — we only explain. Your bank does the enrolment.
