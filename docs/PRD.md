# PRD — DhanYukti (धनयुक्ति)

**One line:** a phone-first, voice-first money companion for Tier 2/3 families earning ~₹30,000/month. It uses consented AA data (Anumati) and Perfios analytics to warn the family about a cash crunch, debt trap or protection gap *before* it happens, and gives one simple next step in their language — as a game the whole family plays.

**Pitch line:** India built open finance so lenders can assess families. DhanYukti uses the same consented data to protect families before they need a loan.
